# Mood Boards

This week we are looking at mood boards. Why need need them and how to make them.  

In the first class we will go over the idea of what a mood board is and in the second sessions we will have a more in depth look into how to create a mood board and what are some good tools to use.  

The idea behind a mood board is to explain the emotions, idea, texture and colours behind a design.
