# Welcome to COMP.5209

In this class we are not going to have "traditional" lectures where you will be presented with some slides at the front of the class.
This class is very much group based driven and the assessments will be geared towards this.

The outcome of this paper is for you to design and create a website, however the coding is not the most important part. The road to solving the problems you have while creating the website is.

In each of the modules in this paper, you will find relevant information that you can go through as a group and as a group you will need to go through the material. The trick to this exercise is that everyone in your group must know each part of the material which you can randomly be quized on at any given time. You can only move onto the next section when you have proven you as a group knows what the section is about.

# Assessments 

This paper has 3 assessments, which will end up being you creating a website as a group. Each assessment will follow on from each other, so make sure you think about the final task when you are working on the first one. The assessment break down is as follows:

1. Investigate the need for the final website you are going to make. Interview people, using PACT, creating flow diagrams and rich pictures.
2. Creating the wireframes, storyboards and moodboards to visualise your designs
3. Code the website to present your work

Even though there are 3 assessments, think about these projects as a whole. You are to research a methodology in which you are to execute these assessments as a group.

You will be given all the assessments at the start so you can get a complete picture of what it is you want to create.

# What will we do as a class

In the first few classes, you will be shown some tools that will help you to complete these tasks. In addition to this in the first class of the week we may cover some of the main topics of this process. The second class is devoted to the practical work of the project.

# Tip 1 - Know your papers

In this class you will learn the process of designing and creating a website, but there are classes you have already done last semester and that you will do this semester that will help you with this paper. See what you can leverage from the other papers to bring into this paper.

# Tip 2 - Implement Scrum

The biggest downfall of assignment work is "Oh it is due on day X, so I don't need to work on it yet".

For this paper we are going to implement a framework called SCRUM, which is based on an agile methodology.

To start of using scrum setup the following system in your group:

Have regular meetings with your group at the same time each week at the start of the 2 classes and cover these questions:

* What was your task
* What did you manage to complete since last time
* What are struggeling with

Any roadblocks that your team has should be resolved by your scrum master and anything you cannot resolve as a group can be resolved with your tutor.

We will have a session on what SCRUM is when we talk about the tools for the class.

Although everyone needs to know about everything in this class as we progress through this class, to have a strong team you will need to fill these roles:

* Leader
* Research
* Artist
* Coder
* Documenation Author
