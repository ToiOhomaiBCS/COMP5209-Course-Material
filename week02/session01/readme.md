PACT is a framework that allows us to think about different design situations. Everytime we think of a product or app design we take it through this process.

When we develop a product we need to think of the:

* the activities that the app or website is used for
* the context in what it is being used in
* the technologies that are being used while

# User flow

Part of the preperation stage we create a number of diagrams, some of these (but not limited to) are:

* Task flows
* User flows
* Flow Diagrams
* Wireframes
