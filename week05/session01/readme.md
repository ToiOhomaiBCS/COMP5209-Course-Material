# Selecting Webframeworks

The web and the life of a web developer is pretty complicated. You need to know about and work with several languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript are there fore the client side. Within those we have a lot of frameworks and libraries.

While web frameworks are there to make our life easier, they are also there to help with things like preventing security holes.

This week we will look at what a framework is and how to install and use it.
